# HTTP: Happy Trying Textile Projects

## Description

Happy Trying Textile Projects is a simple repository of craft ideas. Users come here to find inspiration for their next project, narrow down crafts by the supplies they have on hand, add projects for other users to gain inspiration, and add projects to their own project list. This app is built using React.

## Project features and requirements

1. HTTP has been created as a single page app using create-react-app.
2. HTTP contains 9 components, organized in a sensible hierarchy so that data are appropriately shared between components.
3. HTTP contains 3 different client-side routes using React Router with appropriate, intuitive naming conventions.
4. HTTP makes an initial GET request to fetch data from a db.json file. State is set using this fetch request.
5. Users can POST new information to the API. State is reset.

### User Journey

As a user, I can:

- View different craft projects.
- Sort the available craft projects in the repository based on craft type.
- Add projects to My Project List.
- Post my own projects to be added to the repository.
